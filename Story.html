       This is story of a person named "T" who found the reason of her EUPHORIA. The colours of the sunrise seem to fade away, the hues of the morning mist seems less impressive
      infront of her beauty.None of them stands tall infront of her radiance even the sun feels so small.She is a ambitious,modest and eloquent student.
      <br>Her life was normal until she met the special person of her life he is "AG".They met like all normal people around but she felt something new as the days goes by,she felt different when he was around her.
       In her bad, in her good,in her gloomy days to her day of success and happiness he didn't promise with words but promised his presence by just staying with her.He became the sunlight
       that rose again in her life.When  T was with him she felt it like a dream. A dream of blue mirage in the desert prior deep inside her.She was so happy,that she cant breathe,
       her surroundings were getting more and more transparent.She could hear the far- away ocean across the dream,over the horizon.It was different from the typical definition of destiny.
     <b> <br>T then came to know that she loves him more. So thought of expressing it to him.She set a day and told him "i've waited all my life, i want to be with you through everything.
          You are the star that turns ordinaries into extrodinaries.One after the another day everything is special.Sometimes i was little stuck up Elevated sky,expaded halls.Sometimes i prayed
          let me run away but your pain is my pain when i realised that i vowed to myself you are my everything".AG then looked into her eyes and told her"7  billion different worlds and you are 
          shining with 7 billion lights in my eyes,you got me ;i dream while lokking at you,I tried but can't stop thinking about you, your are the gift god gave himself.If i was a planet you my moon
        i'd stop spinning just by looking at you".</b>AG was a chestnut and acron, the seed of everything good to come,her AG had a heart of gold, anyone cold see mighty goodness within him
          He is a active,admirable,gifted as he got 'T',humble,kind-hearted,worthy person.He then took her hand then T knew that AgG "is the cause of her EUPHORIA".They were the starlight that shines brighter in the darkest night.
